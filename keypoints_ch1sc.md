# A Scalable Language

---

- _Scala_ stands for "scalable language"

- Eric Raymond introduced the cathedral and bazaar as two metaphors of soft-
  ware development.

- _Scala_ runs on the standard Java platform

- _Scala_ is a blend of Object-Oriented and Functional Programming

- _Scala_ it is designed to be extended and adapted by the people programming in it

- _Scala_ offers an additional library that implements Erlang's actor model for work with concurrency.

- _Scala_ runs various control structures that are not built-in control structures. This methods are defined in Scala's library.

- Scalability in _Scala_ is mainly influenced by its combination of OO and FP.

- _Scala_ is an object-oriented language in pure form: every value is an object and every operation is a method call.

- _Scala_ is a full-blown functional language.

- Alonzo Church with lambda calculus which he developed in the 1930s

- Lisp was the first FP language. 

- Two main ideas of FP are : 
  
  - Functions are first-class values. This means you can treat a first-class functions as an Integer or a String. You can pass them as parameters to other functions, return them as results from functions and even you can declare functions inside functions just as you declare an Integer inside a function. A first-class function can or cannot have name and you can store them in variables.
  
  - Operations of a program should map input values to output values rather than change in place. Another way to express this idea is that methods should not have any _side effects_. They should communicate with their environment only by taking arguments and returning results.

- A method is _referentially transparent_ if for any given input the method call could be replaced by its result without affecting the program's semantics.

- Functional languages encourage immutable DS and referentially transparent methods.

- *Scala is compatible:* Uses Java's standard library, uses the types of data, runs on JVM

- *Scala is concise:* Type inference, Less code compare to Java, Do not need to rewrite a lot of code because it is  implemented in a library.

- *Scala is high-level:* Raises the level of abstraction in the interfaces you design and use.

- _Scala is statically typed:_ Type inference,

- _Verifiable properties_

- _Safe refactorings_

- _Documentation_

- _Scala_'s design has been influenced by many programming languages and ideas in programming language research.

- The historic root of extensible languages that can span different applications areas is Peter Landin's 1966 paper "The Next 700 Programming Languages"

- Other programming languages tahat combine OO with FP are Ruby, Smalltalk, Python.
